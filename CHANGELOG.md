kOS Mod Changelog
=================

# v0.20.0 KSP 1.1 Hype!

This release is functionally identical to v0.19.3, it is recompiled against the
KSP 1.1 release binaries (build 1230)

### BUG FIXES
* [KSP1.1] Removing a node leaves an artifact (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1572 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1576)
* [KSP1.1] Toolbar button doesn't display (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1573 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1569)

# v0.19.3 Last (intended) 1.0.5 update.

(This is the last planned update to work with KSP 1.0.5 unless
it breaks something big that requires an emergency patch.)

### BREAKING CHANGES
* Triggers may now go beyond the limits of the IPU (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1542) but are no longer guaranteed to execute within a single update frame.  See http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/general/cpu_hardware.html#triggers and http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/general/cpu_hardware.html#cpu-update-loop for more details.

### NEW FEATURES
* Profiling output via `ProfileResult()` (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1534)

### BUG FIXES
* Removed delay when enabling/disabling auto changeover for multi mode engines (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1451)
* Improve performance of various math functions (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1553 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1523 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1563)
* `on` logic now evaluates expressions and suffixes, instead of requiring a raw variable (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1376 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1542)
* Documentation no longer inserts a space around highlighted search terms (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1548)
* You can now use lock objects with the same identifier from within compiled scripts, like `lock throttle...` (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/691 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1253 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1557 https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1561)
* The script parsing logic has been updated to improve compile times by roughly 50% (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1566)

# v0.19.2

This release is here primarily to fix a problem that made
the new v0.19.1 terminal unusable for users who have to
use low resolution texture settings in the Unity graphics
configuration panel.

### BREAKING
* Nothing new breaking in this version is known about.

### NEW FEATURES
* New alias KUNIVERSE:FORCEACTIVE() can be used instead of the longer name KUNIVERSE:FORCESETACTIVEVESSEL().
* More robust use of the font_sml.png file allows for replacement of font_sml.png by the end-user.
  (However this may only be useful for a limited time, as Unity5 might make us implement the font differently
  anyway.)

### BUG FIXES
* New terminal now works again at low texture resolution settings
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1513).
* New terminal shows grey color on power-off again
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1525).
* Terminal now shows a boot message that mentions the documentation URL
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1527).
* Fixed a situation that could make KSP itself crash if a script
  attempted to perform an equality comparison on types that hadn't
  had a meaningful implementation of equality defined.  (Instead
  of a proper error message about it from kOS, kOS got stuck in
  recursion.)


# v0.19.1

This release is a patch to v0.19.0, fixing some things
found by the user community in the two days shortly after
v0.19.0 released.

It also happens to contain a few terminal window features
that were being worked on before v0.19.0 but were not deemed
ready yet when 0.19.0 was released.

### NEW FEATURES
* PIDLoop tutorial section in the docs edited to mention new PIDLoop()
  function that did not exist back when that page was first written.
  (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/tutorials/pidloops.html)
* New Terminal GUI doodads and widgets: A brightness slider,
  and the ability to zoom the character width and height.  Also
  made the transparency and dimming of the 'non-active' terminals
  a bit less severe so you can still read them when un-focused.
  Also, these new features can be script controlled by new
  suffixes, however it is unclear if that feature (doing it from
  a script) will remain in the future so use it with care:
  (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/terminal.html)

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed file rename bug on local hard disks:
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1498)
* Fixed boot files can be larger than the local disk
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1094)
* Fixed a bug where Infernal Robotics would break when switching vessels or
  reverting. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1501)
* Fixes problems with using PartModule's SetField(), and infernal Robotics which
  had been failing for all cases where the field was a "float".
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1503).
  There may have been other places this bug affected, but this is
  where it was noticed.  Hypothetically, anywhere the stock game's
  library insists on only accepting a single-precision float and
  not a double would have had the problem.
* Improve steering when small control magnitudes are required.
  (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1512)

# v0.19.0

### BREAKING CHANGES
* As usual, you must recompile any KSM files when using the new version.
* Vecdraw :SCALE no longer applied to :START.  Only applied to :VEC.
* Varying power consumption might make it so if you have high IPU settings some designs might run out of power when they didn't before.  (in most cases it should draw less power for most people).
* !!!! Default extension of ".ks" is no longer applied to all new filenames created.  But it still will be looked for when reading existing files if you leave the extension off !!!!
* FileInfo information now moved to Volume (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/volumes_and_files/volume.html).
* VOLUME:FILES was returning a LIST(), now it returns a LEXICON who's keys are the filename.
* String sort-order comparisons with "<" and ">" operators were implemented wrongly and just compared lengths.  Now they do a character-by-character comparison (case-insensitively).  On the off chance that anyone was actually trying to use the previous weird length-comparison behavior, that would break.

### NEW FEATURES
* Art asset rework.  The meshes and textures of the kOS CPU parts have recieved an update, and a new KAL9000 high-end computer part was included.
* Varying power consumption.  Units of electric charge used now varies depending on CPU speed and how much the CPU is being actually used.  If your IPU setting is low, or if your program isn't doing very much and is just stuck on a `wait` statement, it won't use as much power. (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/general/cpu_hardware#electricdrain)
* Ability to read and write whole files at a time as one big string. (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/volumes_and_files/volumefile.html)
* User Functions can now be referred to with function pointers, or "delegates".  (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/language/delegates.html)
* Automatic serialization system to save/load some kinds of data values to JSON-format files (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/commands/files.html#writejson-object-filename)
* User Programs and Functions now allow trailing optional parameters with defaulted values. (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/language/user_functions.html#optional-parameters-parameter-defaults).
* There are now some suffixes that work on all value types, even primitive scalars.  To accomplish this, a new "encapsulation" system has wrapped all kOS structures and primitive types inside a generic base type.  (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/reflection.html)
* ENGINE type now supports multi-mode cases and has its gimbal accessible through :GIMBAL suffix (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/vessels/engine.html)
* Added GIMBAL:LIMIT suffix. (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/vessels/gimbal.html)
* Better support for DMagic's Orbital Science mod (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/addons/OrbitalScience.html)
* Char() and Unchar() functions for translating unicode numbers to characters and visa versa (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/math/basic.html#function:CHAR)
* New Range type for iterating over hardcoded lists (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/collections/range.html).
* Ability to iterate over the characters in a string using a FOR loop, as if the string was a LIST() of chars.
* New higher level cpu part. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1380)
* HASTARGET and HASNODE functions (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/bindings.html?highlight=hastarget)
* :JOIN suffix for LIST to make a string of the elements (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/collections/list.html#method:LIST:JOIN)
* KUNIVERSE now lets you read hours per day setting (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/kuniverse.html#attribute:KUNIVERSE:HOURSPERDAY)
* The reserved word ARCHIVE is now a first-class citizen with proper binding, so you can do SET FOO TO ARCHIVE and it will work like you'd expect.
* New Lexicon creation syntax to make a Lexicon and populate it all in one statement. (http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/collections/lexicon.html?highlight=lexicon#constructing-a-lexicon)

### BUG FIXES
* Numerous additional checks to prevent control of other vessels the kOS CPU isn't attached to.
* The error beep and keyboard click sounds now obey game's UI volume settings. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1287)
* Fixed two bugs with obtaining waypoints by name. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1313) (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1319)
* Removed unnecessary rounding of THRUSTLIMIT to nearest 0.5%, now it can be more precise. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1329)
* Removed the ability to activate both modes on multi-mode engine simultaneously.
* LIST ENGINES now lists all engines and displays part names instead of module names. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/issues/1251)
* Fixed bug that caused hitting ESC to crash the telnet server. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1328)
* Some exceptions didn't cause beep, now they all do. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1317)
* Vecdraw :SCALE no longer applied to :START.  Only applied to :VEC. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1200)
* Fixed bug that made up-arrow work incorrectly when the cursor is at the bottom of the terminal window. (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1289)
* A multitude of small documentation fixes (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1341)
* Fixed a bug when performing an undock (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1321)
* IR:AVAILABLE was reporting incorrectly ()
* Boot files now wait until the ship is fully unpacked and ready (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1280)
* The Vessel :HASBODY (aliases :HASOBT and :HASORBIT) suffix was in the documentation, but had been lost in a refactor last year.  It is put back now.
* String sort-order comparisons with "<" and ">" operators were implemented wrongly and just compared lengths. Now they do a character-by-character comparison (case-insensitively)
* Small documentation edits and clarifications all over the place.

### KNOWN issues
* Using `lock` variables in compiled scripts with a duplicate identifier (like "throttle") throws an error (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1347 and https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1253).
* Occasionally staging with a probe core or root part in the ejected stage will break cooked steering (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1492).
* The limitations of RemoteTech integration can be bypassed by storing a volume in a variable before the ship looses a connection to the KSC (https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1464).

# v0.18.2

[Insert witty title here :-P]
------------------------------

### BREAKING CHANGES
* As usual, you MUST recompile all KSM files before running them on the new version.  Some of the changes have altered how the VM works.
* Nothing else... we hope.

### NEW FEATURES
* Compatibility with KSP version 1.0.5
* `run once ...` syntax to run a script only once per session ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/commands/files.html#run-once-program )
* Volumes and processors have better integration ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/structures/vessels/volume.html#structure:VOLUME )
* Volume titles default to the name tag of the Processor part (only on launch) ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/general/volumes.html#naming-volumes )
* New suffixes for interacting with kOS Processor modules (including `core`) ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/commands/processors.html )
* `debuglog(...)` function to print directly to the KSP log file ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/kuniverse.html#method:KUNIVERSE:DEBUGLOG )
* New `queue` and `stack` data structures ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/queue.html and http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/stack.html )

### BUG FIXES
* The processor's mode (on/off/starved) is now saved and restored ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1172 )
* Fixed stage resources again to address a change in KSP 1.0.5 ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1242 )
* Fix occasional instances of flight controls getting disabled during a docking/undocking/staging event ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1205 )
* kOS can now trigger module events with RemoteTech installed and no KSC connection ( https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/437 )
* Fixed handling of multiple thrust/gimbal transforms and corrected some of their directions ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1259 )

# v0.18.1

Steering More Much Betterer
----------------------

### Changes
* Changed default MaxStoppingTime to 2 seconds ( was 1 )

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed a issue where the effect of the Kd parameter of PIDLoop was having a reversed effect #1229
* Fixes an issue where NO_FLOW resources ( eg SolidFuel ) were not reporting correctly #1231

# v0.18

Steering Much Betterer
----------------------

### BREAKING CHANGES
* As usual, you MUST recompile all KSM files before running them on the new version.  Some of the changes have altered how the VM works.
* New LOADDISTANCE obsoletes the previous way it worked ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/loaddistance.html )
* Fixed broken spelling of "ACQUIRE" on docking ports.  The old spelling of "AQUIRE" won't work anymore.
* Changed the bound variable "SURFACESPEED" to "GROUNDSPEED" instead, as the meaning of "SURFACESPEED" was confusingly ambiguous.
* New arg/param matching checks make some previously usable varying argument techniques not work.  (We don't think anyone was using them anyway).
* Disabled the ability to control vessels the kOS computer part is not actually attached to.  This always used to be possible, but it shouldn't have been as it breaks the theme of kOS.  This affects all the following: vessel:control, part:controlfrom, part:tag (can still get, but not set), partmodule:doaction, partmodule:doevent, partmodule:setfield (can still getfield).  These things become read-only when operating on any vessel other than the one the executing kOS module is actually part of.

### NEW FEATURES
* THE BIG ONE:  Fix to Cooked Steering! Should help people using torque-less craft like with Realism Overhaul. Removed the old steering logic and replaced it with a nice auto-tuning system. ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1118 )
* SteeringManager structure to let users tweak parts of the new steering system ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/steeringmanager.html )
* PIDLoop structure to let users see parts of the new steering system, and to let them use the built-in PID system for their own needs ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/pidloop.html  )
* String manipulation methods. ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/string.html )
* New Lexicon (Associateive Array) type. ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/lexicon.html )
* New Science Experiment control interface allows scripts to directly execute science experiments, bypassing the on-screen prompts. ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/vessels/scienceexperiment.html )
* CrewMember API to let you query the registered crew - their class, gender, and skill ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/vessels/crewmember.html )
* Infernal Robotics API now lets you get Part containing a servo ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1103 )
* (user docs) Better tutorial for KSP 1.0 areo mode. ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1081 )
* A few more constants: C, ATMTOKPA, KPATOATM. ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/math/basic.html )
* DYNAMICPRESSURE, or Q ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1085 )
* DEFINED keyword ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/language/variables.html#defined )
* Load and Pack Distance manipulation ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/loaddistance.html )
* KUniverse structure letting you break the 4th wall and revert from a script ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structures/misc/kuniverse.html )
* Added SolarPrimeVector to provide universal longitude direction ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/bindings.html#solarprimevector )

### BUG FIXES
* Made `stage:liquidfuel` more sane. ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/513 )
* LIST BODIES returned unusuable structure type ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1090 )
* Made "ORBIT" and alias for "OBT" and visa versa ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1089 )
* Made vecdraws stop showing bogus atmospheric burning effects ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1108 )
* Removed non-functional broken attempts to save/restore variables ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1098 )
* KSM files didn't store relative jumps right, breaking short-circuit boolean logic ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1137 )
* (user docs) many minor docs fixes.
* Lock throttle inside a FROM loop was broken ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1117 )
* Unlock anything inside a Trigger body was broken ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1151 )
* Replaced KSP's incorrect ground speed with our own calculation ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1097 )
* SASMODE "radialin" and "raidialout" were swapped in the KSP API ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1130 )
* Bug with remote tech allowing access without antenna in one case ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1171 )
* Wheelsteering by integer compass heading was broken ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1141 )
* SHUTDOWN didn't shut down immediately ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1120 )
* Remote Tech delay, and the `wait` command, were ignoring the time warp multiplier ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/723 )
* Better detection of arg/param matching.  ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1107 )
* Doing PRINT AT that runs offscreen threw an error ( https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/813 )

# v0.17.3

1.0.4 Release

* Deprecated INCOMMRANGE - now throws an exception with instructions to use the new addons:rt methods.
* Updated maxtthrust and availablethrust calculations for KSP v1.0.x.  Due to the way KSP handles thrust, neither available thrust nor maxthrust values are constant at all altitudes around bodies with atmospheres.
* Boot files are now stored on local hard drives with their original names.  You may get or set the boot file name using CORE:BOOTFILENAME suffix.

# v0.17.0

FUNCTIONS! FUNCTIONS! FUNCTIONS!
--------------------------------
Big feature: You can make your own user-defined functions, that
can handle recursion, and can use local variable scoping.  You can
build a library of your own function calls and load them into your
script.

**New Documentation change page**:

For those users who just want to see what new features
exist without reading the entire documentation again
from scratch, we have created a changes page in the main documentation:

* New Changes Page: http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/changes.html

For the features mentioned below, you can go to the page above
and get a more verbose description of the new features.

### New Features:

A brief list of what's new:

* Variables can now be local
* Kerboscript has User Functions
* Community Examples Library
* LIST() now takes args to initialize the list.
* Physics Ticks not Update Ticks
* Ability to use SAS modes from KSP 0.90
* Blizzy ToolBar Support
* Ability to define colors using HSV
* Ability to highlight a part in color
* Better user interface for selecting boot scripts
* Disks can be made bigger with tweakable slider
* You Can Transfer Resources
* Kerbal Alarm Clock support
* Query the docked elements of a vessel
* Support for Action Groups Extended
* ISDEAD suffix for Vessel

This update is so full of new features that instead of describing all of their
details here, you can go see them on the main docs page at the following link:

http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/changes.html

### Bug Fixes:

- Using the same FOR iterator in two loops no longer name clashes because it's not global anymore.
- Repaired a number of boot file selection bugs.
- Removed a few unnecessary debug log spamming message.
- Fixed a minor issue with the special hidden file .DS_Store that Macs insert into the Scripts folder.
- Fixed bug spamming nullrefs when panel was open in the VAB/SPH editor.
- Fixed bugs where setting warp could crash KSP. Now it clamps warp to valid values.
- Fixed bug where kOS CPU's were drawing power from the batteries even when the game was paused.
- Fixed bug where rate of power consumption varied depending on animation frame rate.
- Fixed bug where WAIT 0 crashed scripts.  Now WAIT 0 waits the min. possible time (1 physics tick).
- Fixed small order of operations problem with expressions containing unary operators like '-', '+', and 'not'.
- Fixed problem where SET TARGET didn't really set it until the next physics tick.  Now it sets immediately.
- Fixed some issues with the use of Action Groups above 10, when Action Groups Extended is installed.
- Fixed bug where VOLUME:RENAMABLE returned the name string, rather than a boolean.
- Fixed bun when printing a VOLUME to the screen and failing to "stringify" it properly.
- Using the unary negation '-' on vectors and directions now works.
- Fixed some major bugs in how the kOS toolbar panel was dealing with scene changes and getting "stuck" on screen.
- Fixed some bugs with the kos Name Tag typing window getting stuck on screen and locking the user out of the UI.
- Fixed bug with reboot not clearing out the state properly.
- Fixed bug where any syntax error caught by the compiler resulted in bogus additional second error message.

###BREAKING:

- **RECOMPILE YOUR KSM FILES!!!** - If you used the COMPILE command in
  the past, changes to the kOS machine code that were needed to support
  variable scoping ended up invalidating any existing compiled KSM files.

- **KSM FILES ARE BIGGER** - compiled KSM files are now larger than
  they used to be for the same source code.  They might not be an
  efficient way to pack your code down to a small disk footprint
  anymore.

- *CONFIG:IPU should be slightly increased*  The new default
  we ship with is 200, to reflect both the change in ML code, and the
  movement to Unity's FixedUpdate for physics ticks.  However if you
  have played kOS in the past, your settings don't get automatically
  overwritten.  You will need to change the setting manually.

- *DECLARE has a new syntax*
  DECLARE _VARNAME_ now requires an initializer syntax as follows:
  - DECLARE _VARNAME_ TO _VALUE_.
  If you leave the TO _VALUE_ off, it will now be a syntax error.
  Also, you can say LOCAL or GLOBAL instead of, or in addition to,
  the word DECLARE.

- *DECLAREd variables are now local*
  Using the DECLARE _VARNAME_ TO _VALUE_ statement now causes the
  variable to have local scope that only exists within the local block
  of curly braces ('{'...'}') that it was declared inside of. To get
  the old behavior you can explicitly say:
  DECLARE GLOBAL _VARNAME_ to _VALUE.

- *FOR iterator now is local*
  The _VARIABLE_ in loops of the form FOR _VARIABLE_ IN _SOMELIST_ now
  has local scope to just that loop, meaning it stops existing after
  the loop is done and you can't use it outside the loop's body.


# v0.16.2

##HOTFIX

* Fixes #609 KOS ignores run command in FOR loop
* Fixes #610 Print AT draws in the wrong place on telnet after clearscreen.
* Fixes #612 doesn't update telnet screen when cur command is longer than prev and you up-arrow

# v0.16.1

##HOTFIX

this fixes #603 the mess that I made of the Node structure, thanks Tabris from the forums for bringing this to our attention.

# v0.16.0

### BREAKING
* Body:ANGULARVEL is now a Vector instead of a Direction.  (This is the same as the change that was done to Vessel:ANGULARVEL in v0.15.4, but we missed the fact that Body had the same problem).  It was pretty useless before so this shouldn't hurt many scripters :)
* Both Body:ANGULARVEL and Vessel:ANGULARVEL now are expressed in the same SHIP_RAW coordinate system as everything else in kOS, rather than in their own private weirdly mirrored reference frame. (Thanks to forum user @thegreatgonz for finding the problem and the fix)
* #536 the 1.5m kOS part has always had trouble with clipping into other parts due to the rim of the cylinder sticking up past the attachment points. The part definition has been changed to fix this, but in KSP new part definitions don't affect vessels that have already been built or have already had their design saved in a craft file in the VAB/SPH.  To see the fix you'll need to start a new vessel design from scratch, otherwise you'll still have the old clipping behavior.

### New Features
* TELNET SERVER.  The biggest new feature this update is the introduction of a **telnet server** you can use to access the terminals in game.  For security, it's turned off by default, but you can enable it with the config radio button.  Full documentation on this new feature is at http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/general/telnet.html
	* Synopsis:
		* Telnet to 127.0.0.1, port 5410
		* Select CPU from welcome menu by typing a number and hitting Return.
		* Your telnet client is now a clone of that CPU's terminal window and can control it.
		* If you want to open it up to others to use (i.e. controlling your KSP game from a second computer),
		  you can use an ssh tunnel to access the local loopback address, or if you just want to throw
		  caution to the wind, you can tell it to stop using loopback and use your real IP address.
		  Be aware of the security risk if you choose this.
* Added HUDTEXT that lets you add text to the screen. Thanks @pgodd !
	* more information here: http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/commands/terminal.html#HUDTEXT
* #72 - Added STAGE:NUMBER and STAGE:READY to allow for staging very close together
* #522 - Added BODY:GEOPOSITIONOF and BODY:ALTITUDEOF for getting body-relative info about a 3D point in space.
* #524 and #523 - mission waypoints now have 3d positions
* In game Terminal is now resizable!  From a script with SET TERMINAL:WIDTH and SET TERMINAL:HEIGHT, or from dragging the lower-right corner of the GUI window.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes #389 - LOCK STEERING broken for RCS-only (no torque) ships.
* Fixes #516 - kOSTags are now applied in the correct MM pass
* Fixes #541 - All BODY: suffixes should now work properly when the body is the Sun without crashing.
* Fixes #544 - Terminal subbuffer won't shrink when up-arrowing to a previous smaller command.
* Fixes #548 - If SHIP is not the same as ActiveVessel, then executing STAGE stages the wrong vessel.
* Fixes #581 - SHIP:CONTROL:PILOTFORE and SHIP:CONTROL:PILOTSTARBOARD are no longer inverted.
* Fixes #578 - renamed our use of RemoteTech2 to RemoteTech to follow their new naming.
* Fixes #427 - Stack now clears when interactive commands throw exceptions.  (no longer reports false stack traces).
* Fixes #409 - Delete no longer leaves file in memory.
* Fixes #172 - Lock states no longer persist through power cycling unit. Now they become default for unlocked state
   * Also #358, #362, #568
* Fixes #580 - RT "signal lost. waiting to re-aquire signal" check previously disallowed manned terminal use.  Now it only disables the terminal if the vessel is unmanned.
* Fixes #344 - KOSArgumentMismatchException reported wrong arg number (i.e. it would claim your 3rd argument is wrong when it's really your 1st argument).  Fixed.


# v0.15.6

### BREAKING
* PART:UID is now a string. This will only break you if you were doing math on UIDs?
* ELEMENT:PARTCOUNT was poorly named and duplicated by ELEMENT:PARTS:LENGTH so it was removed.

### New Features
* (AGX) Action Groups Extended Support! Thanks @SirDiazo
	* Getting or setting groups 11-250 should behave the same as the stock groups if you have AGX installed.
	* Groundwork is laid for getting parts and modules by the new action groups.
* Gimbals are now a well known module. providing read access to its state
* Added PART:GETMODULEBYINDEX(int). This is most useful when you have a part with the same module twice. Thanks @jwvanderbeck
* More documentation work. http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes RemoteTech Integration
* Structures can now be correctly ==, <> and concatenated with +
* STAGE:RESOURCE[?]:CAPACITY is now spell correctly :P

# v0.15.5
The KSP 0.90 compatibility release.
(The full thematic following of KSP 0.90's new way of
thinking will come in a future version. This is just
to make sure everything works.)

###BREAKING CHANGES
* Now respects the limitations of [0.90 career mode upgrades](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/general/career_limits.html), which may make a few features not work anymore in career mode until you get further progressed along in your building upgrades.

###New Stuff
* Thanks to a new dev team contributer Johann Goetz (@theodoregoetz on github), we have a new, much better and cleaner looking [documentation site](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/)
* Better flight input handling to detect the pilot controls and keep them isolated.
* "plays nice" with other autopilots a bit better, using KSP 0.90's new autopiloting hooks.
* Ability to read [more data about a ship resource](TODO - Are these in the docs?  Put URL here if so.) TODO:  i.e. SingleResourceValue:FLOWMODE, for example - see PR #452)
* New [suffixes to handle directions better](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/math/direction.html) as mentioned in [long detail in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7byYiZZBBVc)
* Separate Dry Mass, Wet Mass, and Current Mass readings for parts and for the vessel as a whole (TODO: Link here, but the public gh-pages hasn't be regenned yet so I don't know the link yet)
* Added new [WAYPOINT object](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/structures/waypoint.html) to help with locations of some contracts.
* Added new :POSITION and :ALTITUDEPOSITION suffixes to [Geocoordinates](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/math/geocoordinates.html) to obtain 3D vectors of their positions in ship-raw coordinate space.

* ADDED muliple new ways to deal with resources.
	* STAGE:RESOURCES, SHIP:RESOURCES and TARGET:RESOURCES will let you get a list of the resources for the craft, the difference being that SHIP: and TARGET: includes all resources and STAGE: includes only the resoures that are for "this stage". All three of these will let you get a list of :PARTS that can contain that resource.
	* Part resources now gives you access to the resource's tweakable :ENABLE and :TOGGLEABLE can let you remove add a resource to the normal resource flow.

###Bug Fixes
* Better handling of range checking and loading the boot file when remotetech is installed (thanks to hvacengi for this contribution)
* Boot file overwrite fix (thanks to pakrym)
* (For developers) fixed compile error on UNIX platforms that was due to filename case-sensitivity differences.
* LOG command to the Archive now appends to the file properly instead of rewriting the entire contents each time just to tack on one line.  It is now possible to read its output from outside KSP using a tool like the UNIX "tail -f" program.
* Better calculations of stage resource values, using SQUAD'S provided API for it instead of trying to walk the tree ourselves (which broke in 0.90).
* Fixed lonstanding [bug with geocoordinates:TERRAINHEIGHT](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/478)

###Small maintenence issues
* Bundling a newer version of ModuleManager
* Better use of the "skin" system for the app panel.  Should see no obvious effect on the surface.


# v0.15.4
###BREAKING CHANGES
* Issue #431: SHIP:ANGULARMOMENTUM and SHIP:ANGULARVEL have been changed from directions to vectors to me more consistant with their nature

#### New Stuff:
* Should now be compatible with KSP 0.90

#### Bug Fixes:
* Issue #421: some local files are corrupt
* Issue #423: its possible to create a file with no extension
* Issue #424: additional bootfile suffix protection
* Issue #429: files sent to persistence file no longer get truncated


# v0.15.3
BugFixes:
* Issue #417: No error message on nonexistent function.
* Issue #413: Name tag window should get keyboard focus when invoked.
* Issue #405: Equality operator is broken for Wrapped structure objects.
* Issue #393: Files on local volume do not persist through save/load.

# v0.15.2

BugFixes:
* :MODULESNAMED returns something useful now #392
* array syntax bugs #387

# v0.15.1

BugFixes:
* All Lists have suffixes again
* in the config panel, IPU no longer gets stuck at 50


# v0.15

## NEW FEATURES:

Please follow the links to see the full information on the new features.

* [Added new kOS GUI panel to the KSP Applauncher system](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/summary_topics/applauncher_panel/index.html).  With this you can alter config values, and open/close terminals from one common panel.  Just click the little kOS logo button in either the editors (VAB/SPH) or in flight view.

* [Added pilot input to flight controls](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/control/index.html#pilot-commands) which lets you read/write the users control state, you can use this to set the exit behavior for the mainthrottle.

* Several suffixes are now [methods that you can call](ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/#structure_methods) with arguments.
	* eg before to add to a list it was SET LIST:ADD TO "FOO". Now it would be LIST:ADD("FOO").

* Suffix methods that perform an action do not need to be assigned to anything.  No more having to say *SET DUMMY TO MYLIST:CLEAR.*  You can now just say *MYLIST:CLEAR.* like it was a statement.

* Added suffixes to OBT for [walking orbit conic patches](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/orbit/index.html)
	* ORB:HASNEXTPATCH - A boolean that shows the presence of a future patch
	* ORB:NEXTPATCH - The next OBT patch

* Added better techniques for selecting the Part you want from a Vessel:
  * Ability to give any part any name you like with the [new nametag feature](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/summary_topics/nametag/index.html).
  * [Directly querying a vessel for parts](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/summary_topics/ship_parts_and_modules/index.html#parts), searching for [nametags](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/summary_topics/nametag/index.html), or part names or part titles.
	* SHIP:PARTSDUBBED(string)
	* SHIP:PARTSNAMED(string)
	* SHIP:PARTSTAGGED(string)
	* SHIP:PARTSTITLED(string)
	* SHIP:PARTSINGROUP(string)
	* SHIP:MODULESNAMED(string)
  * [Walking the parts Tree](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/part/index.html):
	* PART:CHILDREN - A ListValue of parts that are descendant from the current part
	* PART:PARENT - A PART that is the ancestor of the current part
	* PART:HASPARENT - A boolean that shows the presence of a Parent PART
	* SHIP:ROOTPART - The first part of a ship.  The start of the tree of parts.  identical to SHIP:PARTS[0].
  * *SET MyList TO SHIP:PARTS.* now does the same thing as *LIST PARTS IN MyList.*

* A [new system lets you access the PartModules](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/partmodule/index.html) that the stock game and modders put on the various parts.  Through this, you now have the ability to manipulate a lot of the things that are on the rightclick menus of parts:
  * PART Suffixes:
	* GETMODULE(string)
	* ALLMODULES.
  * PartModule Suffixes:
	* GETFIELD(field_name) - read a value from a rightclick menu
	* SETFIELD(field_name, new value) - change a value on a rightclick menu, if it would normally be adjustable via a tweakable control.
	* DOACTION(name_of_action_) - cause one of the actions that would normally be available to action groups *even if it hasn't been assigned to an action group*.
	* DOEVENT(event_name) - "presses a button" on the rightclick part menu.
	* Several others..

* [Lists are now saner to work with](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/list/index.html) with no longer needing to use weird side effects to get things done, now that there's proper methods available:
  * :ADD has changed:
	* Old Way: *SET MyList:ADD TO NewVal.*
	* New Way: *MyList:ADD(NewVal).*
  * :REMOVE has changed:
	* Old Way: *SET MyList:REMOVE TO indexnumber.*
	* New Way: *MyList:REMOVE(indexnumber).*
  * :CLEAR has changed:
	* Old Way: *SET Dummy to MyList:CLEAR.*
	* New Way: *MyList:CLEAR().*

* Added ENGINE:AVAILABLETHRUST suffix. A value that respects the thrust limiter

* Added SHIP:AVAILABLETHRUST suffix. A sum of all of the ship's thrust that respects thrust limiters

* Added a [new experimental COMPILE command](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/command/file/index.html#compile-1-to-2), for making smaller executable-only programs to put on your probes without punishing you for writing legible code with comments and indenting.

* [Filename convention changes](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/command/file/index.html#volume-and-filename-arguments):
  * Commands that deal with filenames will now allow any arbitrary expressions as the filename, except for the RUN command.
  * *Exception*: The above does NOT apply to the ```RUN``` command.  The run command requires that the filenames are known at compile time, and it cannot allow arbitrary expressions evaluated later at runtime.
  * Program files are now called *.ks instead of *.txt.  When you first run the new version, it will give you an option to rename your files to the new name for you as they are moved to the new location.
  * Although the default script filenames use *.ks, you can override this and explicitly mention filename extensions in all the filename commands.  What you can't do is have filenames with no extensions.

* Added support for CKAN

* Added config file so kOS will now show up in Automatic Version Checker (AVC)

## CHANGES BREAKING OLD SCRIPTS:

* BREAKING: **.txt files are now .ks files**: The new assumed default file extension for files used by kOS is *.ks rather than *.txt.  This may confuse old IDE's, or your computer's assumed file associations.
* BREAKING: **VesselName**: Removed previously deprecated term "VESSELNAME", use "SHIPNAME"
* BREAKING: **SHIP:ORB:PATCHES**: Moved SHIP:ORB:PATCHES to SHIP:PATCHES and it now contains all orbit patches
* BREAKING: **Lists**: New syntax for using :ADD, and :REMOVE suffixes for lists requires old code to be altered.  See features above for the new way.
* WARNING: **Bundled ModuleManager**: Because kOS now needs ModuleManager, and ModuleMangaer complains about being run on Windows 64bit, you now see a new warning message if you run kOS on Windows 64bit, but the message is ignorable and kOS still runs.
* BREAKING: **identifiers as filenames**: If you use the same name for a filename as the name of a variable, in a file command such as COPY, DELETE, etc, then kOS will no longer use the variable's name as the filename but will now use the variable's contents as the filename.

## BUG FIXES:

* [PartValue:POSITION not using ship-relative coords](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/277)
* [Boot file name is case sensitive](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/311)
* [Engine reports maxthrust on :ISP suffix](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/331)
* [LIST VOLUMES IN <list> makes an empty list.](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/308)
* [Parser doesn't understand THING[num]:THING[NUM] or thing[index]:suffix(arg)](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/268)
* [ship:obt:patches seems to be missing some of the patches](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/252)  (Note: in addition to fixing it, the patches list was moved to just ship:patches, which makes more sense).
* [Compiler should throw exception on trying to put a WAIT in a trigger.](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/254)


- - -


## V0.14.2

* Added entry cost to kOS parts
* extended button lockout to include the full throttle button (default z)
* updated the reference to RemoteTech rather than RemoteTech2

## V0.14.1

* Kerbal Space Program 0.25 Support
* OnSave and OnLoad should no longer disappear your craft. This is a bit of a stop-gap fix that doesn't guarantee that the kOS part will be happy, but at least your craft will still be there.
* Resolves #257 by unbinding the X key from throttle cutoff while the window is in focus.
* KSP AVC Support
* Added Body:RotationalPeroid

# v0.14

### New Hotness
* Updated fonts, Thanks @MrOnak
* Now runtime errors show source location and call stack trace (Github issues #186 and #210).  Example:
~~~
	Tried To push Infinity into the stack.
	At MyProgramFile2 on Archive, line 12
		PRINT var1/var2.
				  ^
	Called from MyProgramFile1 on Archive, line 213
	RUN MyProgramFIle2("hello").
	^
	Called from StartMission on Archive, line 2.
	RUN MyProgramFile1.
	^
	_
~~~
* (WHEN and ON) Triggers that are taking longer than an Update is meant to take, and thus can freeze KSP are caught and reported (Github issue #104).  Gives the user an explanatory message about the problem.
  * WARNING: Because of a change that had to be done for this, it is **_Highly_ recommended that you increase your *InstructionsPerUpdate* setting in config.xml to 150% as much** as it was before (i.e. from 100 to 150, or if it was 200, make it 300.).
* Multiple Terminal Windows - possible to have one open per CPU part.  (Github issue #158)

![Multiple Windows!](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/blob/master/Docs/Images/MultiEdit.png)

### Old and Busted ( now fixed )
* "rename" was deleting files instead of moving them. (Github issue #220).
* Was parsing array index brakets "[..]" incorrectly when they were on the lefthand side of an assignment.  (Github issue #219)
* SHIP:SENSORS were reading the wrong ship's sensors sometimes in multi-ship scenarios.  (GIthub issue #218 )
* Integer and Floating point numbers were not quite properly interchangable like they were meant to be. (Github issue #209)


# v0.13.1
* Fixed an issue with Dependancies that kept kOS modules from registering

# v0.13

## MAJOR
* BREAKING: Commrange has more or less been removed from stock kOS, we realized that most of the behavior of it was copied by other mods and was invisible to users
* BREAKING: All direction references are now relative to the controlling part, not the vessel, this will only break on vessels there these two directions are not the same.
* BREAKING: Direction:Vector will always return a unit vector.
* BREAKING: Body:Velocity now returns a <a href="http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/orbitablevelocity/">pair of orbit/surface velocities</a> just like Vessel:Velocity does. (previously it returned just the orbit velocity as a single vector.)
* BREAKING: Direction*Vector now returns the rotated Vector, and vectors can be rotated with DIRECTION suffix.
* BREAKING: DOCKINGPORT:DOCKEDVESSELNAME is not DOCKINGPORT:DOCKEDSHIPNAME
* SHIP:APOAPSIS and SHIP:PERIAPSIS are deprecated for removal later, you can find them both under SHIP:OBT
* SHIP:VESSELNAME is deprecated for later removal, use SHIP:NAME or SHIPNAME


## New Features
* Added the ability to get and set the current timewarp "Mode" either RAILS or PHYSICS
* Added Boot files that will run when you get to the pad automatically, you select which one will run in the VAB thanks @WazWaz
* <a href="http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/vessel/">Vessels</a> and <a href="http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/body/">Bodies</a> now <a href="http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/structure/orbitable/">can be used interchangeably as much as possible.</a>
* Three new prediction routines for <a href="http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/command/prediction/"> finding state of an object at a future time: </a>
* POSITIONAT( Object, Time ).
* VELOCITYAT( Object, Time ).
* ORBITATAT( Object, Time ).
* you can now get the FACING of all parts.
* ITERATOR:END is now split into :NEXT and :ATEND
* Direction can now always return a proper vector.
	* IE SHIP:FACING returned V(0,0,0) before
